# Just Intonation (JI) Canvas

A project to create music with JI tuning, using an interactive musical stave and score.

Currently the app presents a table in a web browser, allowing user can set up sequenced notes individually, and save to a Redux state.

Future work will be to move the note editing from a table to a musical score using an HTML canvas, mouse and keyboard together.
